  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:

  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # such as FTP and Heroku are also available. See the documentation at
